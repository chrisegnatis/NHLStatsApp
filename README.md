### Greeting all hockey fans!

To see the app, clone the repo. and run the app with 'npm start'.

Project created with *Reactjs*, implements many API calls to fetch important data, utilizes *TypeScript* for code security and *Tailwind CSS* for styling.

Note: this project is not yet complete to my standards. But it is runnable, and progress is being made.
